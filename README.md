# ECSE_526_F2017

Default language is Python3.6, and will probably be compatible with 3.5/3.4
Questionable backwards compatibility for 2.7
Versions of numpy/pip used will be for python3.

The current plan for implementation is to design a layer object, and a neural net object
Operations will be based in matrix arithmetic, to levrage numpy
numpy can be acquired by "pip install numpy" unless pip is not installed
for pip, "sudo apt-get install pip"

the gitignore is configured to ignore the structure files generated by the project manager used (PyCharm), add other non-code files as needed
